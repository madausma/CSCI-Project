     <h1>Mercury</h1>
     <p>The first and closest known planet to the Sun</p>
   </div>
   <div class="row">
     <div class="col-sm-4">
       <h3>Composition</h3>
       <p>Mercury is a terrestrial planet, like like all of the 4 inner planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. It�s the smallest of them, and has a diameter of only 4,879 km at its equator. What is the composition of Mercury? Astronomers have estimated that the Mercury composition is made up of approximately 70% metals and 30% silicate material. In fact, it�s only slightly less dense than the Earth, with 5.43 g/cm3. Since Mercury is smaller than Earth, its gravity doesn�t compress it down as much, so it actually has much more heavier elements inside it. Geologists estimate that its core is very large, and mostly iron. The core probably accounts to 42% of Mercury�s volume, while Earth is just 17%. The core itself is about 3,600 km across. Surrounding that is a 600 km thick mantle. And around that is the crust, which is believed to be 100-200 km thick. The crust is known to have narrow ridges that extend for hundreds of kilometers. Planetary scientists think that the ridges formed when the planet cooled and contracted underneath the crust, causing it to collapse down.</p>

       <h3>History</h3>
       <p>Mercury was discovered by known since ancient times at no data in not known. Origin of name: named after the planet "Mercury" (the origin of the symbol Hg is the Latin word "hydrargyrum" meaning "liquid silver")
Mercury was known to ancient Chinese and Hindus before 2000 BC and was found in tubes in Egyptian tombs dated from 1500 BC It was used to forma amalgams of other metals around 500 BC. The Greeks used mercury in ointments and the Romans used it, unfortunately for those using it, in cosmetics.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="col-sm-4">
       <h3>Moons</h3>
       <p>Mercury has no moons. Given Mercury�s small size (the smallest planet in the Solar System) and its proximity to the Sun, it�s gravity is too weak (and it�s Hill Sphere too small) to retain a natural satellite. Basically, if a large object were to approach Mercury today, to the point that it actually entered its Hill Sphere, it would likely be snatched up by the Sun�s gravity instead. Another way in which Mercury could not have acquired a moon has to do with the scarcity of material in its orbit. This may be due to solar winds and the condensation radii of lighter materials, where trace substances like hydrogen and methane remained in gaseous form nearer to the Sun during Mercury�s formation, and were thence swept away. This left only elements like iron and and nickel in solid form, which then coalesced to form Mercury and the other terrestrial planets.
