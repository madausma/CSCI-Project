     <h1>Saturn</h1>
     <p>The sixth closest known planet to the Sun</p>
   </div>
   <div class="row">
     <div class="col-sm-4">
       <h3>Composition</h3>
       <p>Saturn's composition is primarily that of simple molecules such as hydrogen and helium, but there is also ice of ammonia, ice of methane and water ice. Under the cloud layers, when the pressure of the interior becomes high enough, the hydrogen of which Saturn is made changes to liquid hydrogen, which gradually changes further to liquid metallic hydrogen. Compared to Jupiter, Saturn does not have as much metallic hydrogen, but there is more ice. Because the magnetosphere comes from the metallic layer, this means that Saturn has a smaller magnetosphere than does Jupiter. At the far interior of Saturn is found the core, which is made of rocky and metal elements.</p>

     <div class="col-sm-4">
       <h3>History</h3>
       <p>Saturn is easily visible with the unaided eye, so it’s hard to say when the planet was first discovered. The Romans named the planet after Saturnus, the god of the harvest – it’s the same as the Greek god Kronos. You can also check out these cool telescopes that will help you see the beauty of planet Saturn. Nobody realized the planet had rings until Galileo first turned his rudimentary telescope on the planet in 1610. Of course, Galileo didn’t realize what he was looking at, and thought the rings were large moons on either side of the planet. It wasn’t until Christian Huygens used a better telescope to see that they were actually rings. Huygens was also the first to discover Saturn’s largest moon Titan.

       <h3>Moons</h3>
       <p>Saturn is well known for being a gas giant, and for its impressive ring system. But would it surprise you to know that this planet also has the second-most moons in the Solar System, second only to Jupiter? Yes, Saturn has at least 150 moons and moonlets in total, though only 53 of them have been given official names. Most of these moons are small, icy bodies that are little more than parts of its impressive ring system. In fact, 34 of the moons that have been named are less than 10 km in diameter while another 14 are 10 to 50 km in diameter. However, some of its inner and outer moons are among the largest and most dramatic in the Solar System, measuring between 250 and 5000 km in diameter and housing some of greatest mysteries in the Solar System.
