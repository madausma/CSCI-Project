		<b><i>The Sun</b></i> (in Greek: <i>Helios</i>, in Latin: <i>Sol</i>) is the star at the center of the Solar System and is by far
		the most important source of energy for life on <a href="earth.html">Earth</a>. It is a nearly perfect spherical ball of hot plasma,
		with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.
		Its diameter is about 109 times that of <a href="earth.html">Earth</a>, and it has a mass about 330,000 times that of <a href="earth.html">Earth</a>, accounting for
		about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of
		hydrogen; the rest is mostly helium, with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon,
		neon and iron.

		The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V) based on spectral class and it is informally referred to as a yellow dwarf.
		It formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region
		of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting
		disk that became the Solar System. The central mass became increasingly hot and dense, eventually initiating nuclear
		fusion in its core. It is thought that almost all stars form by this process.
		The Sun is roughly middle aged and has not changed dramatically for over four billion years, and will remain fairly
		stable for more than another five billion years. However, after hydrogen fusion in its core has stopped, the Sun will
		undergo severe changes and become a red giant. It is calculated that the Sun will become sufficiently large to engulf
		the current orbits of <a href="mercury.html">Mercury</a>, <a href="venus.html">Venus</a>, and possibly <a href="earth.html">Earth</a>.
		The enormous effect of the Sun on <a href="earth.html">Earth</a> has been recognized since prehistoric times, and the Sun has been regarded by
		some cultures as a deity. Earth's movement around the Sun is the basis of the solar calendar, which is the predominant
		calendar in use today.
